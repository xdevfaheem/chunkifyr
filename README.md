# Chunkifyr 📜🔪

**Chunkifyr** is a powerful and flexible python library designed to split and chunk text into meaningful segments. Whether you're processing large documents, preparing chunks for RAG application, or simply need to manage text in manageable chunks, Chunkifyr provides a range of customizable chunking strategies.

## Features ✨

- **Language Model Chunking**: Leverage the context understanding of languag models to chunk text based on semantic understanding.
- **Syntactic Chunking**: Break down text into syntactically meaningful segments, preserving grammatical structures.
- **Semantic Chunking**: Group text into semantic segments.
- **Customizable Settings**: Easily adjust chunk sizes, overlap percentages, and more to fit your specific needs.
- **Robust and Fast**: Efficiently handles large texts, and it's pretty smooth btw.

## Installation 🛠️

Install Chunkifyr via pip:

```bash
pip install chunkifyr
```
```Note: Python 3.8+ is required.```

## Usage 🚀

Here’s a quick example using **LMChunker** to get you started:

```py
from chunkifyr import LMChunker
from openai import OpenAI

# this creds can be replaced with your local oai server creds, if your running local OAI server. (llama_cpp, llamafile, ollama)
client = OpenAI(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY", base_url="DEPLOYMENT_URL") 

chunker = LMChunker(model="gpt-3.5-turbo-0125", client=client)
chunks = chunker.from_file('path_to_your_text_file.txt')

for i, chunk in enumerate(chunks, 1):
    print(f"Chunk {i}: {chunk.text}")
    print(f"Chunk {i} description: {chunk.meta.description}")
    print()
```
This example demonstrates how to use the LMChunker with an OpenAI client to break a text file into meaningful chunks. Each chunk also includes a description generated by the model. (which can be further used as metadata when embedding)

## Available Chunkers

- **LMChunker:** Utilizes pre-trained language models for contextual chunking.
- **SimpleSemanticChunker:** Groups similar splits together for basic semantic chunking.
- **SimpleSyntacticChunker:** Simple syntactic chunking with desired chunk size, overlap and seperator. (very similar to langchain character splitter)
- **SemanticChunker**: Groups text semantically using the Adjacent Sentence Clustering process with a configurable similarity threshold.
- **SyntacticChunker:** Chunks text based on syntactic structures using customizable tokenization (supports hf_tokenizer, tiktoken).
